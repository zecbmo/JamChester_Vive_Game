TROPHIES PLEASE! Puzzle Micro-Management VR Game

You are a guy who wins at life, at everything, and you just can't get enough of these trophies. The trophies are piling through the door and you have got to clean and care for them properly before putting them on your trophy shelf. As the day goes on more trophies keep coming through that letterbox.

Better get cleaning in the best VR game.


Unity3D and HTCVive required. 

Done in 40hrs at JamChester GameJam,  therefore commits questionable and not to be taken seriously, also pair programming, and shared computer used at times, so commit name doesnt always match, and sleep deprivation did kick in.

Current best branch gaffs. 

Will be continue development on this game for some extra polish.
